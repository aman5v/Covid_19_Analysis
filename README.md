# Covid-19 Analysis of the year 2020 & 2021 (India) | Python (Jupyter Notebook)

NOTE : MUST HAVE THE "POWER BI DESKTOP" TO VIEW THE DASHBOARD.

Created insights on the Covid-19 data of year 2020 and 2021 in different States
and UTs of India.

Used pandas to create useful dataframes.

Used matplotlib and seaborn to plot and create insights of deaths, cured and
confirmed cases.

Also used python functions to find out and fill the null datas.

status.
